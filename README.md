#Intro
This is a simple one page website for displaying information for getting started on a Raspberry Pi. There is no javascript on this site, but it uses bootstrap. 

##Motivation
This project was created as an intro assignment during a course at Emily Carr University for interaction design. 


##Images
There are 21 images on the site. They are all found in the folder. 

##Next Steps
I would love to add javascript functionality so that the button changes colour when it is clicked, and so that when an accordion button is pressed the browser adjusts to jump to that section. I would also love to maximize the mobile responsiveness as it is not quite there yet.
