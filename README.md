### raspberry-pi.design
#Intro
This is a simple one page website for displaying information for getting started on a Raspberry Pi. There is no javascript on this site, but it uses bootstrap. 

##Motivation
This project was created as an intro assignment during a course at Emily Carr University for interaction design. 

##Images
There are 21 images on the site. They are all found in the folder. 

##Installation
Simply download the code and run it in your code editor! Feel free to edit anything, or play around with adding javascript. 

##Next Steps
Would love to play around with having the button change colour, having the browser jump to the parts
